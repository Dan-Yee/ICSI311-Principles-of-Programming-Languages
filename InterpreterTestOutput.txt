Please enter your name Dan
How old are you? 20
Where are you from? New York

Nice to meet you Dan! wow...you are much older than I am. I'm very sure that 20 year(s) is a lot more than 1 year
So, you're from New York. A very nice place!

I'm from Albany. Here some information about where I'm from!
Albany is the capital of New York. As of 2019, the population here is 97478.
The current temperature here is 77.5*F

Here's some really random functions I can perform and have already done for you

A random integer is 2126399680
The 3 leftmost characters of the word Washington is Was
The 6 rightmost characters of the word Washington is ington
Look at the word I've extracted from the word Washington :D. It's: hi
Integer 5184423300 to String because I can! 518442330
Float 3.14159265358979 to String because I also can! 3.1415927
String to Integer because why not! 518442330
String to Float because YESSSSSS! 3.1415927
Another word in the middle of another word (Albany)! ban

On top of that I can do basic addition, subtraction, multiplication and division on Integers and Floats :D Wooohooo!
Did you know that 2 + 2 equals 4 and that 2 * 2 also equals 4? Math is so cool!
Wow look at that! 1000 / 100 equals 10
OH WOW, 1 - 1 equals 0 and 1 - -1 equals 2
I can also perform orders of operations! (3.14 + 3.14) * 3.14 = 19.719202
Here's another example! 2 * (3 + 3) = 12
Adding integer variables? No problem. Allow me to demonstrate. aa = 10 and b = aa + 10. b equals 20 and aa + b equals 30
Whats that? You want to see floats? No problem. c% = 3.14152 and d% = c% * c%. d% equals 9.869148 and c% + d% equals 13.010668
Copying variables :D. e = 10, f = e, therefore f = 10

Testing more complex Math expressions
Value of ((y%+b%)*b%)+(y%*8.8) is: 36.64
x = a+a+a+a+a+a+a+a, therefore x is : 16
Passed Complex Math expressions
